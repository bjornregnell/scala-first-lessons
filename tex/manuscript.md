# Scala First: Lessons from 3 student generations

Hello everyone! I'm very happy to be invited to Scala days to share with you what we learned from teaching Scala first to 3 generations of Computer Science and Engineering students at Lund University. 

# Who am I

My name is Bjorn Regnell and I am a software engineering professor at LTH, which is the engineering faulty of Lund University in Sweden. I discovered the power of Scala almost ten years ago in two different ways: First in my working on an embedded DSL for software requirements engineering, starting back in 2010, and then in 2011 when I as a side project worked in our science center with programming experiments for kids in primary school using the beginner-friendly open source IDE Kojo, maintained by Lalit Pant in India, to which I have cotributed with translations.
